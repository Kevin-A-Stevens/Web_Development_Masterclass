    <title>How CSS works</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Three Pillars of writing good HTML & CSS code</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive Design</li>
      <li>Maintainable & Scalable code</li>
      <li>Web Performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cascade</h2>
    <p>
      Process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between
      different CSS rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies to a
      certain element
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Importance (weight)</li>
      <li>Specificity (inline, IDs, Classes, Elements)</li>
      <li>Source order</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Not all properties are inherited.</p>
    <p>padding is not inherited, but line-height is</p>
    <p>
      properties related to text are inherited, such as font-size, font-family,
      color, etc
    </p>
    <h2>Converting px to rem, An effective workflow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>set font-size to 10px percentage in html element</li>
      <li>10 / 16 = 0.625 = 62.5%</li>
      <li>You can now use rem such as 16px = 1.6rem. 20px = 2 rem</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Component driven design</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Think about the components that will make up your design. They should be
        reusable across the project(s)
      </li>
      <li>Build using BEM (Block Element Modifier)</li>
      <li>Block = stand-alone component such as .block</li>
      <li>Element = Has no meaning on it's own such as .block__element</li>
      <li>
        Modifier = Makes a different version of an element, such as
        .block__element--modifier
      </li>
      <li>Architect by organizing your code using 7:1</li>
      <li>7 folders for partial SASS files and 1 main SASS file</li>
      <li>
        7 folder: base, components, layout, pages, themes, abstracts, and
        vendors
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
